# NewPortfolio

Here is my official, brand new portfolio. I wanted to create a portfolio that is genuinely 100% me. I began this project by creating a wireframe in Adobe XD
which  took around 2 weeks to polish up. After that, I started building! As of right now, I haven't used any CSS frameworks and I highly doubt that I would
add one to my current work (I'm writing this a lot later than when I began building). I hope this turns out to be really awesome! I'm confident that it will.

Cheers!
